    "As we can see, the final results on the test dataset are not exactly what we anticipated earlier. During the GridSearch and optimization process, we worked exclusively with the training dataset, so it’s natural that the performance slightly decreased when the model was evaluated on unseen test data. This difference reflects how well the model generalizes to new examples, which is the ultimate goal of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite not using more advanced tools such as a detailed confusion matrix analysis or feature importance evaluation, we still achieved reasonably strong results. The outcome demonstrates that even classical machine learning methods can perform well when the data is properly prepared and the model is tuned thoughtfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is not the best possible solution to the problem. As stated at the beginning, this tutorial was created solely for the purpose of a recruitment task — the goal was to present a clear, comprehensible approach rather than to maximize performance or use overly complex methods that might confuse ML beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to improve the results further, you can explore more advanced techniques such as model ensembling, feature selection, or hyperparameter optimization with libraries like Optuna or Bayesian Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "That concludes this tutorial — good luck with your recruitment task, and keep exploring machine learning!"
